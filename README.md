## Overview
This project documents my experience working on a SOC Simulator, a realistic cybersecurity analyst environment designed to enhance threat intelligence and incident response skills.

## Tools Used
- **Splunk SIEM** – for centralized log collection and analysis  
- **Wireshark** – network traffic analysis  
- **PowerShell** – automation and incident investigation  
- **VirusTotal** – file and URL reputation analysis  

## Project Description
I participated in a simulated SOC environment where I:
- Analyzed alerts in real-time and classified them as malicious or benign  
- Investigated phishing campaigns and suspicious process relationships  
- Correlated digital evidence to determine attack sources and response strategies  
- Prepared AI-reviewed incident reports highlighting IOCs and mitigation actions  

## Results & Skills Gained
- Achieved 100% accuracy in identifying true positives and false positives  
- Managed and resolved 21 alerts with a mean response time of 3 minutes  
- Strengthened skills in **digital forensics, technical analysis, and real-time incident response**
